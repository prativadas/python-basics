# print different patterns

# start by simply printing the patterns like this

print('','','','*','')
print('','','*','*','')
print('','*','*','*','')

#matrix printing
# for i in range(3):                    # i represents the number of rows. for loop starts at i=0 and stops at i=2
#     for j in range(3):                # j represents the number of cols. 3*3 matrix. run debugger to see how it prints.
#                                       # inner for loop stops at j =2.then outer for loop i=1. then inner for loop executes 3 times so on.
#         print('*', end='')            # end='' doesnt come to a new line after print
#     print()                           # executes for outer for loop.
